      " Even musical scores and recordings, while as much tangible things as paintings and poems, are merely containers that hold the potential for musical experience and not the music itself. Most contemporary popular music is in the form of songs, in which texts are set to a melody and supported by instrumental harmonies. If we want to categorize or describe such music by its lyrical content, we can still 5. The key idea that made deep learning possible is the use of “backpropagation” to adjust the weights on features by working backwards from the output (the object classification produced by the network) all the way back to the input. Mathematically-sophisticated readers can find a concise explanation and history of deep learning in (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015). LeCun and Hinton were part of research teams that independently invented backpropagation in the mid 1980s. Today, LeCun heads Facebook’s research group on artificial intelligence, and Hinton has a similar role at Google. Describing Non-text Resources | 501 rely on methods for describing texts.

      " Used with permission.) On a more granular level, musicians are endlessly innovative in finding ways to categorize, describe, and analyze not simply large-scale musical genres, but the notes themselves. In the accompanying photo showing the record collection of professional DJ “Kid Kameleon,” we see that the records are arranged not simply by genre, but also by beats-per-minute (BPM). For Kid Kameleon, these records represent the resources of his musical creative process, and arranging them by BPM allows him to pull exactly the correct musical material he needs to keep the music flowing during a performance. His classification system is therefore a taxonomy that moves from the broad strokes of genre down to the fine grains of specific arrangements of notes and rhythms. This photo is not simply a picture of a record collection: it is a visual representation of an artist’s creative process.9 9. This method of organizing musical resources for ready access (physically and cognitively) is one that has both an illustrious past and a fascinating future. \n",

      " Likewise, the “egghead” position that “categories are in the mind” has been called rational, constructive, top-down, experiential, and embodied—and they are also not synonyms. See (Bulmer 1970). See also (Lakoff 1990), (Malt 1995). 3. Is there a “universal grammar” or a “language faculty” that imposes strong constraints on human language and cognition? (Chomsky 1965) and (Jackendoff 1996) think so. Such proposals imply cognitive representations in which categories are explicit structures in memory with associated instances and properties. In contrast, generalized learning theories model category formation as the adjustment of the patterns and weighting of connections in neural processing networks that are not specialized for language in any way.

      " Just as there are many laws and regulations that restrict the organization of physical resources, there are laws and regulations that constrain the arrangements of digital ones. Many information systems that generate or collect transactional data are prohibited from sharing any records that identify specific people. Banking, accounting, and legal organizing systems are made more homogeneous by compliance and reporting standards and rules. Organizing Mental Resources Memories can be viewed either as physical (because at some level they are represented in the brain) or as digital (because they are retrieved as electrical impulses), but memory techniques like the method of loci and memory palaces reify this duality in an interesting way. While physical resources must be stored in physical locations, our powerful spatial memory provides an opportunity for us to, in a sense, store mental resources in physical locations. Our hippocampus, the brain component dedicated to memory, is highly developed for storing and recalling memories of physical locations. Organizing Resources | 203 The ancient Greeks relied on this capability and devised a mnemonic system—the method of loci—which involved attaching things to remember, the key ideas in a speech perhaps, to well-known physical locations. \n",

      " (3) Information-as-thing: The term “information” is also used attributively for objects, such as data and documents, that are referred to as “information” because they are regarded as being informative, as “having the quality of imparting knowledge or communicating information; instructive.” (Oxford English Dictionary, 1989, vol. 7, p. 946). A key characteristic of “information-as-knowledge” is that it is intangible: one cannot touch it or measure it in any direct way. Knowledge, belief, and opinion are personal, subjective, and conceptual. Therefore, to communicate them, they have to be expressed, described, or represented in some physical way, as a signal, text, or communication. Any such expression, description, or representation would be “information-as-thing”. We shall discuss implications of this below. Some theorists have objected to the attributive use of the term “information” to denote a thing in the third sense above.

The hierarchy is mentioned in nearly twenty textbooks, but their close analysis by (Rowley 2007) reveals only partial agreement on the definitions and relationships among the four key concepts. The hierarchy has been criticized as lacking in philosophical rigor (Fricke 2009) and for ignoring the context-specificity of how knowledge is learned and applied (Jennex 2009).

Four aspects of information. A Reverse Approach: What is Informative? Instead of the tedious task of reviewing candidate objects and inquiring whether or not they should be considered to be examples of information-as-thing, we can reverse the process and ask people to identify the things by or on account of which they came to be informed. People Buckland, Information as thing. JASIS, 1991. 4 will say that they are informed by a very wide variety of things, such a messages, data, documents, objects, events, the view through the window, by any kind of evidence. This point was recognized by Brookes (1979, p. 14): “In the sciences it has long been recognized that the primary source of information is not the literature of the sciences but observation of the relevant natural phenomena. Scientists (and others) find 'sermons in stones and books in the running brooks'.” How might we best sort out these candidates for being regarded as information? \n",

(See “Organizing with Properties of Physical Resources”) • What are some of the ways in which the mind follows Gestalt principles and imposes simpler interpretations on visual sensations? There are always multiple interpretations of the sensory stimuli gathered by our visual system, but the mind imposes the simplest ones: things near each other are grouped, complex shapes are viewed as simple shapes that are overlapping, missing information needed to see separate visual patterns as continuous or whole is filled in, and ambiguous figure-ground illusions are given one interpretation at a time. (See the sidebar, Gestalt Principles) • How can built environments influence the expectations, behaviors, and experiences of everyone who enters the space? Built environments can be designed to encourage or discourage interactions between people, to create a sense of freedom or confinement, to reward exploration or enforce efficiency. 292 | Key Points in Chapter Three (See “Organizing Built Environments”) • How can we define the activity of “Information Architecture” using the language of the discipline of organizing? \n",
